# In-cluster launcher

The launcher combines an operator-like module and the actual application logic.
The example uses a simple http server as the application logic.

## Preparation

Make sure install dependencies described in the `README.md` file at the top of
the repository.

Then you can build and run the in-cluster launcher on the local kind cluster by
running `build.sh`.
